# Smash Ultimate GSP Hider
This mod hides your Global Smash Power for online Quickplay modes.

## Is it WiFi-safe?
This mod only changes the display of GSP, it does not prevent you from losing or gaining it.  
You can confirm this by holding `R` in the Quickplay menu, which will reveal your GSP.

## Places GSP is hidden

* Solo Quickplay (including Elite Smash)
* Quickplay results screen

## Places GSP is not hidden

* Online modes without GSP (Co-op Quickplay, Tournament, Battle Arenas, Local Wireless)
* Spectate (including GSP shown in Shared Content)
* Single-player modes (Classic Mode, All-Star Smash, Home-Run Contest, etc.)

## ARCropolis support
If ARCropolis is detected (the mod checks for the `romfs/skyline/plugins/libarcropolis.nro` file),
some strings will be added for the character selection screen.  
The mod still works without it, instead showing symbols for the buttons to hold.
